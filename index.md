## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at [Australian AI Intelligence Institute (AAII)](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/australian-artificial-intelligence-institute), [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/), working on ***Federated Intelligence***. I have worked as a Research Intern at [Shenzhen Institue of Meteorological Innovation (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Weather Research Center for Monitoring Warning and Forecasting)](https://weather.sz.gov.cn/gbamwf/zhongxingaikuang/). Previously, I earned my Master at Hainan University. My research focuses on bridging the gap between academic research and real-world applications.

***<span style="color: Red;">Remark.</span>*** I believe that collaboration is essential for success, similar to the fundamental principles of federated learning. If our research areas **(see Research Interest)** intersect, I am eager to engage in collaboration, aiming to acquire valuable insights from others. ***<span style="color: blue;">Please feel free to drop me an email</span>***.

## Research Interests

- **Federated Intelligence:** Federated Foundation Model for the Dynamic World Modeling (e.g., Time Series, Climate Change, Remote Sensing, and Healthcare)
- **Scientific Machine Learning:** PDE Solver, Computational Materials
