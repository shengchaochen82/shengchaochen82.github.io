## About Me


I am a Ph.D. student at Australian AI Intelligence Institute (AAII), University of Technology Sydney, working on Federated Intelligence. I have worked as a Deep Learning Research Intern at Shenzhen Institue of Meteorological Innovation（Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Weather Research Center for Monitoring Warning and Forecasting）. Previously, I completed an MPhil at the Hainan University and a BEng at Jiangxi University of Science and Technology. Now, my research focuses on bridging the gap between academic research and real-world applications. If you have any fun ideas or just want to have a chat, please feel free to drop me an email
