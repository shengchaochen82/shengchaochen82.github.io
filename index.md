## About Me


I am a Ph.D. student at Australian AI Intelligence Institute (AAII), University of Technology Sydney, working on Federated Intelligence. I have worked as a Deep Learning Research Intern at Shenzhen Institue of Meteorological Innovation (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Weather Research Center for Monitoring Warning and Forecasting). Previously, I completed an MPhil at the Hainan University. Now, my research focuses on bridging the gap between academic research and real-world applications. If you have any fun ideas or just want to have a chat, please feel free to drop me an email.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning
